# Machine Learning Basics
This repository tests several machine learning algorithms on two different datasets in order to explore basic **Machine Learning** concepts: 
  - **Small Dataset**: Fewer features, lower complexity,   
  - **Large Dataset**: More features, higher complexity

The algorithms implemented are based on the **Machine Learning laboratory exercises**, with plans for future improvements.
